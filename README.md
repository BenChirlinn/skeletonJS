#SkeletonJS

Simple template for triggering JS based on GetSkeleton

A simple JS snippet that will trigger whenever a CSS breakpoint is hit in the getSkeleton CSS framework.

##Use:

Simply put whatever functions you want execute in the main if statement. Watch your scope. This snippet is in a contained self-executing function to avoid polluting global scope but feel free to add your own script in or copy it to where you need it. You can set multiple resize and ready calls so don't worry about duplicates if you're already using them in your own code. Enjoy!
